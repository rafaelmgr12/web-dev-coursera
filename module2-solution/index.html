                    Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist
                    who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two 
                    pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics)

            <p>Richard Feynman was an American theoretical physicist,
                known for his work in the path integral formulation 
                of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics,
                the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium,
                as well as his work in particle physics for which he proposed
                the parton model</p>
